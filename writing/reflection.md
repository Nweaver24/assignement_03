##### Questions Over a Selected Plot

Choose a plot from the slides of 20 September 2021 and address the below questions.
Questions

 1. What plot did you choose for this critique? Please describe the plot by mentioning the title and slide number.

I chose plot 1, this plot was about gun deaths in Florida related to a new law.

 2. For this plot, what did you find was wrong with its information in terms of its presentation of the data?

 In the plot the colors were a little misinforming, it made it look like the numbers weren't as high as they were by sort of reversing the numbers from what they would traditionlly look.

 3. If the graph has been plotted in a way that was less misleading, would the "message" of the plot still be the same? In other words, was this plot designed to mislead? How?

  I think the plot was designed to be misleading, as it is set up in a way to make you think the opposite of what is actually true.

 4. Can you think of any ethical problems that may result from a misunderstanding of the data in the plot? What type of upset or damage could result from this misunderstanding?

  People may believe that the numbers are different than what they actually are, this would create a group of people that believe false information.

 It was interesting to see everybody's different opinions and feelings on things.
