This assignment requires students to study plots which have misleading information and to respond to the _questions in blue_ which are listed in the `writing/reflection.md` file.  


## GitHub and Markdown

 - First, please familiarize yourself with GitHub. For example, [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) provides a good reference guide. If you require more help, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

 - You can also watch a video on [Markdown Tidbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdJEUAy5IyA&list=PLsYZRXov75ZHSwWiCk0-jd1RcTuu_-zmD&index=5).
